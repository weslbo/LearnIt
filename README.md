# LearnIt

A repository of jupyter notebooks that help you skill up with Microsoft Learn. It supports following magic commands:

%%learn 
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-to-azure-app-service/

This will "screen scrape" the learn module (and all of its units)


%%question
What is Azure App Service?

This will respond the question using gpt-4o


%%audio
What is Azure App Service?

This will respond the question using gpt-4o but also converts this to spoken language audio

For an example, see [test.ipynb](test.ipynb)
