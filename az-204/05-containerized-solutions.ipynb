       "- **Revisions:** ACA uses a concept called \"revisions\" to manage different versions of your application. Each time you update your app's configuration or deploy a new image, a new revision is created. This allows you to easily roll back to a previous version if needed.\n",
       "- **Traffic Splitting:** ACA allows you to split traffic between different revisions, facilitating canary deployments, A/B testing, or blue-green deployments. You can control the percentage of traffic directed to each revision.\n",

       "\n",
       "**Kubernetes:**\n",
       "- **Manual Control:** Kubernetes provides more granular control over deployments using objects like Deployments, StatefulSets, and DaemonSets. You can define update strategies (e.g., rolling updates, canary releases) and manage them manually.\n",
       "- **Custom Strategies:** Kubernetes allows you to implement custom deployment strategies, including complex scenarios like blue-green deployments or A/B testing, using tools like Helm or operators.\n",
