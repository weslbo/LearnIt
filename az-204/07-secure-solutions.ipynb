       "\n",
       "1. **Centralized Management**: App Configuration allows you to manage settings centrally rather than distributing appsettings.json files across different services.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Dynamic Configuration**: You can change configuration settings dynamically without redeploying or restarting your applications.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Feature Flags**: It supports feature management, enabling you to toggle features on and off without code changes.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Versioning and Labels**: You can label configurations for different environments and versions, making it easier to manage changes.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Enhanced Security**: Integrates with Azure Key Vault for secure storage of sensitive information, and uses managed identities for access control.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Point-in-time Replay**: It allows you to retrieve settings as they were at a specific point in time.\n",
